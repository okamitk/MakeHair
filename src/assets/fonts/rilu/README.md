<h5 align="center">NOTE: This font is on beta RN, it might have a lot of errors/issues, so if you find one, please, report it on the Issues tab. For now, most non-english characters will be broken (specially characters with "D"s, horns, tildes, waves and circumflexes). I promise, I'm working on it!</h5> 

## ‚ùì What is this?

#### Rilu is an open-source font made to be fun, modern, and imperfect at the same time. It's a mix between Mono, Serif, and Sans.

## ü§® This looks like [insert random font]!

#### It does, indeed! Rilu is based on a few OFL fonts:

- Readex Pro

- Work Sans

- DM Sans/Mono

- Space Grotesk/Mono

## ‚ú® Showcase

Fixing some stuff right now, showcase soon!
